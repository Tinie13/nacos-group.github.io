## Verifying This Change

XXXX

Adhere to this checklist to facilitate the swift and effortless incorporation of your contribution:

* [ ] Ensure a Github issue exists for the change (typically before starting work), except for trivial changes like typos. Your pull request should address solely this issue, avoiding inclusion of additional changes â€“ one PR resolves one issue.
* [ ] Format the pull request title as `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit within the pull request should have a meaningful subject and body.
* [ ] Compose a pull request description that sufficiently elucidates the change, its methodology, and rationale.
* [ ] Develop necessary unit tests to validate your logic corrections, employing more mocks when dealing with cross-module dependencies. If introducing a new feature or significant modification, remember to include integration tests in the [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).
* [ ] Execute `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs` to confirm the passage of fundamental checks. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to ensure unit tests pass. Execute `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to verify the success of integration tests.
* [ ] For substantial contributions, please submit an [Apache Individual Contributor License Agreement](http://www.apache.org/licenses/#clas).
