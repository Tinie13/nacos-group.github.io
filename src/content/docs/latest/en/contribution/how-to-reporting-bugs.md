# How to Submit a Bug Report

Should you encounter any issues or documentation problems within the Nacos project, please inform us by [opening an issue](https://github.com/alibaba/nacos/issues/new). We take errors and bugs very seriously; no problem is insignificant in front of our product. However, before creating a bug report, please verify if there's an existing issue reporting the same problem.

To ensure your bug report is accurate and easy to understand, attempt to include the following details:

- Be specific. Include as many details as possible: which version, what environment, what configurations, etc. If the error relates to running the Nacos server, attach the Nacos logs, with startup logs being particularly crucial.

- Reproducible. Outline the steps to reproduce the issue. We understand some issues may be difficult to reproduce, but include any steps that might lead to the problem. If possible, append the affected Nacos data directory and stack strace to the bug report.

- Avoid duplication. Do not replicate existing bug reports.

Before filing a bug report, it's advisable to read Elika Etemad's article on [submitting good bug reports](http://fantasai.inkedblade.net/style/talks/filing-good-bugs/), which could be enlightening.

We may request additional information from you to pinpoint the bug. Duplicate reports will be closed.
